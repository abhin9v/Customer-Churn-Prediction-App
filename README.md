Customer Churn Prediction App

This application predicts customer churn using a TensorFlow-based deep learning model deployed via Streamlit. It processes user-provided customer data (e.g., geography, gender, credit score, age, tenure, balance, etc.) to compute the probability of churn.

Key Features:
Simple User Interface: Intuitive input fields for user-friendly interaction.
Pre-trained Model: Powered by a TensorFlow neural network for high accuracy.
Data Preprocessing: Uses pre-trained encoders and scalers for categorical and numerical data.
Real-time Results: Displays churn probability and a clear churn/no-churn status.
Tech Stack:
Streamlit: Interactive web application framework.
TensorFlow: Machine learning model for predictions.
Scikit-learn: Encoding, scaling, and preprocessing.
Pandas & NumPy: Efficient data handling and computations.
